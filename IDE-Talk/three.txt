What is an IDE?

- IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment.

- An IDE combines a text editor with other coding tools such as:

    > Debugging tools e.g. break points, trace tables.

    > File and module management tools.

    > Collaboration / cloud tools like github.

    > Emulators, e.g. running a mobile application.
