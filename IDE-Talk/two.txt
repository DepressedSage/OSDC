What makes a good Text Editor for coding?

- Automatic indentation.

- Syntax highlighting.

- Predictive text for keywords/variable names.

- Auto line numbering.

- And most importantly: DARK MODE
  (basically the ability to customize themes)

- All these features are available in Vim and Sublime Text.
