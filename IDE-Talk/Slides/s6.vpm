What is Vim?

- Now let us get into the meat of today's talk.

- It is an Advanced programmer's text editor.

- Advanced how you may ask?
  Well this presentation you see is running in Vim :D

- Designed expressly for efficient text editing.

- IDE-like features not built-in, but multitudes of plugings.

- Incredibly powerful--will double your productivity (only if you give it time i.e.)

- It does have a steep learning curve and might scare the first time users.
